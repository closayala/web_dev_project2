      <h2>Do you play sports too?</h2>
      <p>Yes I do! I don't play any sports for IIT but I'm usually always playing basketball at any court I can find running 2's, 3's, or 5's. I also sometimes play flag football during the fall season with a big group of people who graduated with me from High School.</p>
